# Chatter

Chatter is my first full-stack web application, built entirely with JavaScript using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Overview

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand how web applications work and how front-end and back-end components interact with each other. The application demonstrates real-time messaging capabilities using Socket.IO.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains two submodules:

- `chatter_front_end`: The React-based front-end application
- `chatter_back_end`: The Express-based back-end server

## Purpose

This project was developed purely for learning purposes to gain hands-on experience with:

- Full-stack JavaScript development
- Real-time communication with Socket.IO
- RESTful API design and implementation
- Front-end to back-end connectivity
- Database operations with MongoDB

## Getting Started

Please refer to the README files in each submodule for specific installation and setup instructions:

- [Back-end README](https://github.com/tawfiqAK17/Chatter_back_end)
